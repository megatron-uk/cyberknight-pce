# Converted

These files were created with the tool 'mapAssets.py' and may have also had manual translations added. They are sourced from the *split* folder.

These files are then used in the 'expandRom.py' tool to generated the English patched Cyber Knight rom file.

These are the *final* data files. Any changes to the script, grammar, or display should be made to these patches.
